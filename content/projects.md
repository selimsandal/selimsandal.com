Here are some projects I'm actively working on:
- Leading a team implementing a custom RISC-V CPU at Ozyegin University Computer Architecture and Systems Technologies lab
- Writing my own machine learning library for C++
- Working on developing a better neural network architecture with long term memory capabilities

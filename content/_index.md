Hey, I’m Selim. I’m a freshman computer science undergraduate student at [Ozyegin University](https://www.ozyegin.edu.tr/en/computer-science-department). For now I’m interested in digital design, integrated circuits, hardware accelerators and deep neural networks. I’m planning to use this website to write about these topics.

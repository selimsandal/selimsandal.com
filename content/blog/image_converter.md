Hey everyone,

I've put together a batch image converter tool recently. It's straightforward, handling multiple files and various formats without the clutter you might find in other tools. Thought it could be useful for some of you as well.

**Here's the gist:**

- **Batch Conversion:** Drag and drop multiple files at once. It's pretty straightforward.
- **Multiple Formats:** It works with most of the common image formats.
- **Simple Interface:** Designed to be easy to use, without unnecessary extras.

I've tested it on both local and network drives and it seems to work fine. But, of course, there might be bugs I haven't caught yet.

Security stuff: I'm on it, working to get the app signed with my own developer certificates across all platforms.

**Download it here:** [App Center](https://install.appcenter.ms/users/selimsandal/apps/image-convert/distribution_groups/public%20release)

Also, the Linux build is in the works, figuring out GitHub CI for QT applications in Linux.

Let me know if you run into any issues or have suggestions. Always looking to make it better.

So after a long while, I returned back to Unity for a small porject. I used versions 2022 and 2021 LTS latest.

I don't remember the exact year but my first experience with Unity was when I was in 5th or 6th grade. Unity looked like the only option to make cross platform games with minimal effort back then. Today, that seems still the case. (Godot seems like a nice option but the development process is not as streamlined as Unity or Unreal Engine and ui is a bit wonky for my preference)

Unreal is also out of equation for me because of the lack of full aarch64 support, you can build it yourself but there are lots of problems.
